    "A **virtual environment** is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated containers for each project. Within each environment, the Python interpreter, libraries, and scripts are independent and isolated from the libraries and packages that are installed in the main Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when we create and activate a virtual environment for a specific project, the project runs as an independent application with its own Python interpreter and its own `pip` for installing packages. This prevents conflicts between projects and protects the global Python installation from accidental changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using separate environments ensures that updates to a library in one project do not affect others, making it easier to reproduce results and collaborate on large projects. For example, one project can use TensorFlow 1.12 while another uses TensorFlow 2.5, without compatibility issues. This way, we won't worry whether an update to the TensorFlow library in the main system-installed Python would impact the code in all our projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several tools for managing virtual environments, including Python's built-in `venv` module which has been available since Python 3.3, and also Anaconda offers a similar feature through its conda environments. Both allow to maintain separate package versions for different projects. Whenever you start a new project, you can simply create a new virtual environment to keep its dependencies isolated."
