    "> **Expressions** are part of statements that return a value, such as variables, operators, or function calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, expressions in Python include `2+5`, or `x+3`, or `x * y` for given `x` and `y`, or `func1(3)` for a given function `func1`, since they all return a value. Expressions perform operations upon objects, and produce a value that can be used in other operations, can be assigned to a variable, printed out, etc. An expression can be part of larger expressions of statements. For instance, in the statement `a = 2 + 5`, the part `2 + 5` is an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Statements** are sections of code that perform an action. The main groups of Python statements are: assignment statements, print statements, conditional statements (`if`, `break`, `continue`, `try`), and looping statements (`for`, `while`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, `a = 2 + 5` is a statement, because it doesn't return a value, but it performs an action by assigning the value of `2 + 5` to the variable `a`. Beside assignment statements (such as `a = 2 + 5`), other forms of statements include conditional statements (e.g., `if x > 5:`), looping statements (e.g., `for i in range(10):`), print statements (e.g., `print('hi')`), as well as there are several other statements, such as `import`, `return`, `pass`, etc. Note again that none of these statements returns a value in the way expressions do. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Modules** are Python files that contain Python statements, and are also called scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a module is a single Python script that is composed of a series of related statements grouped into one file. The statements in a module can assign values to variables, create functions or classes, or perform other actions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Packages** are Python programs that collect related modules together within a single directory hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a package is a directory that contains a collection of module files. Packages can also contain sub-packages, forming a hierarchy of packages. A Python program can be organized into a single package, or more complex programs can use multiple packages to achieve its functionality.\n",

    "The `if` statement takes the form of an `if test`, which can be followed by one or more optional `elif (else if) tests`, and a final optional `else test`. Each of the tests has an associated block of nested statements, indented under a header line.\n",
