By integrating these two modalities, VLMs can understand and communicate about visual content using natural language.\n","\n","VLMs take both an image and its textual description as input and generate text as output. Building datasets for such models requires large scale collection of image and corresponding text, typically in the form of captions or descriptive phrases. Several very large such datasets exist that have been essential for training modern VLMs and contain billions of image-text pairs, with descriptions in English and other languages. For instance, the [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) dataset has over 5.8 billion image-text examples.\n","\n","<img src=\"images/vlm_structure.png\" width=\"450\">\n","\n","*Figure: VLM structure.* Source: [1].\n","\n","During training, a VLM learns to map visual and textual representations into a shared embedding space.

The user prompts are shown on the left, and the model responses are given on the right. As demonstrated in this example, VLM models can not only interpret the semantic content of images, but can also understand spatial relations in images, such as identifying relative positions of objects, generating segmentation masks, outputting bounding boxes of objects, and performing other spatial tasks.\n","\n","<img src=\"images/VLM_capabilities.jpg\" width=\"650\">\n","\n","*Figure: VLM prompts and responses.* Source: [2].\n","\n","In general, VLMs can perform various multimodal tasks including:\n","\n","- Image and video captioning/summarization: generate context-aware descriptions of images or video frames.\n","- Visual Question Answering (VQA): answer open-ended questions based  on visual content.\n","- Image-based reasoning: provide explanations or logical reasoning about visual scenes.\n","- Multimodal dialogues: engage in conversations involving visual inputs.\n","- Text-to-image search: retrieve images, figures, or diagrams in documents that match a textual query.\n","- Image generation: generate new images based on textual prompts."],"metadata":{"id":"5c4bRNh9lnUB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 22.2.1 VLM Workflow <a name='22.2.1-vlm-workflow'></a>"],"metadata":{"id":"Vxhi7aHnnF_x"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Despite differences among architectures, most VLMs share a similar workflow with the main components shown in the figure above\n","\n","**Multimodal inputs**. Input modalities in VLMs include *visual inputs* (images, pdf documents, videos) and *textual inputs* (captions, question-answer pairs, instuctions).\n","\n","**Encoding Modalities.** A *vision encoder* transforms the visual input into numerical representations known as visual embeddings. The vision encoder in VLMs is commonly a Vision Transformer (ViT) or a Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs). A *text encoder* converts textual prompts into textual embeddings. The text encoder is typically a pretrained LLM, such as LLaMA, Mistral, or Qwen.\n","\n","**Projection and fusion into a joint embeddings space.** The visual and textual embedding are next aligned into a shared embedding space.

A common approach begins with frozen visual and textual encoders, while the projector layer is trained to align their embeddings. In later stages, additional finetuning is performed to update the  text encoder and projector for improved multimodal reasoning.

In the figure below, an image encoder outputs image embeddings $I_1, I_2, I_3, ..., I_N$, and a text encoder outputs text embeddings $T_1, T_2, T_3, ..., T_N$.

Moreover, these tasks require users to manually label a large number of images with a specific category or assign bounding boxes to multiple objects in each image for object detection, which is a tedious, time-consuming, and expensive process.\n","\n","Conversely, VLMs are trained with more  detailed textual descriptions of images, where for example an image can contain cats, dogs, and other objects, as well as, the text description can provide additional contextual information (e.g., the cat is sitting, the dog is running, etc.). Learning from rich natural language descriptions allows VLMs to better understand visual scenes without limiting the learning to a narrow set of visual concepts comprising a fixed number of categories and objects. Also, it eliminates the need for exhaustive manual image labeling and extends VLMs utility beyond traditional CV tasks like classification or detection to new capabilities including reasoning, summarization, question answering, and interactive dialogue, by simply changing the text prompt.\n","\n","VLMs have been applied across many domains and industries, and offer great potential for enhancing visual perception. For instance, they can be used to review videos and extract insights for industrial inspection and robotics (detect faults, monitor operations, identify anomalies in real time), safety and infrastructure monitoring (recognize floods, fires, or traffic hazards), retail and logistics (track empty shelves, detect misplaced items, identify supply-chain bottlenecks), and numerous other tasks."],"metadata":{"id":"cXozhEaErru5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 2.2.3 VLM Finetuning <a name='22.2.3-vlm-finetuning'></a>"],"metadata":{"id":"OWKHrZNos2BH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We are excited to announce that TRL’s SFTTrainer now includes experimental support for Vision Language Models!
