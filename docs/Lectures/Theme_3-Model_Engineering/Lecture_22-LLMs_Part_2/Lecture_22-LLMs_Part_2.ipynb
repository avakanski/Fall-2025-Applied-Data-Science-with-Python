Differently from Ensemble Methods, MoE introduces dynamic routing of the input to different experts, as well as, all experts in MoE are trained as part of a single neural architecture rather than as separate learners.\n","\n","**MoE Components**\n","\n","A typical MoE architecture is shown in the figure below and consists of two key components:\n","\n","- **Experts**: each expert is typically a fully-connected neural network trained on different parts or properties of the input. Each expert specializes in processing different types of inputs, such as token types, contexts, or semantic patterns.\n","\n","- **Router or gating network**: analyzes the inputs and determines which tokens are sent to which experts. It acts as a coordinator that routes the inputs to the selected experts.\n","\n","When MoE receives input data, it first passes the data through the gating network. The gating network analyzes the input and selects the experts to receive the data. Typically, only a small subset of experts is activated for each input. The selected experts then process the data and generate outputs, which are combined to produce the final output of the MoE.\n","\n","<img src=\"images/moe_components.png\" width=\"450\">\n","\n","*Figure: Main components of MoE.* Source: [1].\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_YRMf0vD5LkM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In most MoE LLMs, the dense Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of Transformers is replaced with a set of experts.

Several different strategies have been proposed that penalize overreliance on any one expert, and reward more even utilization of all experts.  \n","\n","In MoE models, each expert learns a different specialization of the overall function. However, the experts do not learn completely separate tasks. Instead, they learn to handle different types of tokens, contexts, or transformations.

Hence, about 14B parameters (two experts) are active during training and inference. Note however, that the overall number of parameters in Mixtral is not exactly 8 x 7B = 56B, since some layers are shared.

The number of parameters that are used to process an individual token is a measure of the model's **computational cost**. Thus, Mixtral has a similar learning capacity to dense LLMs with 47B parameters, but has a much lower computational cost because only 14B parameters are used per token.\n","\n","Note also that although 14B parameters are active per token, the entire Mixtral model with 47B parameters needs to be loaded into memory to perform inference.

Therefore, LLMs cannot answer questions about current events, and they are stuck in the time moment of their training data. Updating LLMs with knowledge about current events requires to continuously retrain the models on new data. Such a process is very expensive, as it requires collecting updated datasets and finetuning the model to update the weights.\n","\n","RAG enables to avoid expensive LLMs retraining, by retrieving information from external databases to generate responses. The RAG approach involves two major phases:\n","\n","- **Retrieval**, includes performing relevancy search of external databases regarding a user query, and retrieving supporting documents and snippets of important information.\n","- **Content generation**, the retrieved supporting documents are used as a context that is appended to the user query, and are fed to the LLMs for generating the final response.\n","\n","Instead of relying only on the information contained in the training dataset used for training an LLM, RAG provides an interface to external knowledge to ensure that the model has access to the most current and reliable facts.

Employing RAG can result in more relevant responses and it can reduce the problem of hallucination by LLMs. It also allows the users to review the sources that were used by LLMs and verify the accuracy of generated responses.

It can allow for example to fetch real-time information from an API or to execute code. A program separate from the LLM watches the output stream of the LLM for a special tool-calling syntax. When these special tokens appear, the program calls the tool accordingly and feeds its output back into the LLM's input stream.\\nEarly tool-using LLMs were fine-tuned on the use of specific tools. But fine-tuning LLMs for the ability to read API documentation and call API correctly has greatly expanded the range of tools accessible to an LLM. Describing available tools in the system prompt can also make an LLM able to use tools. A system prompt instructing ChatGPT (GPT-4) to use multiple types of tools can be found online.\\n\\n\\n=\",\n          \"== Limitations and challenges: Political bias ===\\nPolitical bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit political biases.

These functionalities were found to be difficult to detect or remove via safety training.\\n\\n\\n=\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Embedding\n","\n","To perform RAG, we first need to create embeddings for all text chunks.
