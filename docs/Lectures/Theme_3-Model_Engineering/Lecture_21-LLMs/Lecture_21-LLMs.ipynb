The model takes the instruction text as input (e.g., \"Write a limerick about a pelican\") and uses next-token prediction to generate the output text (e.g., \"There once was a pelican so fine ...\").\n","\n","The finetuning process involves updating the model's weights using supervised learning techniques. The objective of supervised finetuning is to improve the quality of the generated responses by the pretrained LLM.\n","\n","To compile datasets for supervised finetuning, AI trainers need to write the desired instructions and responses, which is a laborious process. Typical datasets include between 1K and 100K instruction-output pairs. Based on the provided instruction-output pairs, the model is finetuned to generate responses that are similar to those provided by AI trainers.\n","\n","<img src=\"images/finetuning.jpg\" width=\"500\">\n","\n","*Figure: Finetuning a pretrained LLM.* Source: [2]."],"metadata":{"id":"LnAjaqBPXlJC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 21.2.3 Alignment <a name='21.2.3-alignment'></a>\n","\n","To further improve the performance and align the model responses with human preferences, LLMs are typically refined in one additional phase. This ensures that the responses generated by LLMs are aligned with human preferences, making the models more useful and safer for interaction with users.

For this step a new dataset is created by collecting sample prompts from a database or by creating a set of new prompts. For each prompt, multiple responses are generated by the supervised finetuned model. Next, AI trainers are asked to rank by quality all responses generated by the model for the same prompt, from best to worst. Such feedback is used to define the human preferences and expectations about the responses by the model. Although this ranking process is time-consuming, it is usually less labor-intensive than creating the dataset for supervised finetuning, since ranking the responses is faster than writing the responses.\n","2. *Create a reward model*. The collected data with human feedback containing the prompts and the ranking scores of the different responses are used to train a Reward Model (denoted with RM in the figure). The task for the Reward Model is to predict the quality of the different responses to a given prompt and output a ranking score. The ranking scores provided by AI trainers are used to establish the ground-truth for training the Reward Model. Note that the Reward Model is a different model than the LLM that is being finetuned, and it only needs to rank the generated responses by the LLM.\n","3. *Finetune the LLM with RL*. The LLM is finetuned using the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). For a new prompt, the original LLM generates a response, which the Reward Model evaluates and calculates a reward score $r_k$. Next, the PPO algorithm uses the reward score $r_k$ to finetune the LLM so that the total rewards for the generated responses by the LLM are maximized. I.e., the goal is to generate responses by the LLM that maximize the predicted reward scores, and by that, the responses become more aligned with human preferences and are more useful to human users.\n","4. *Iterative improvement*. The RLHF process is performed iteratively, with multiple rounds of collecting additional feedback from human labelers, re-training the Reward Model, and applying Reinforcement Learning. This leads to continuous refinement and improvement of the LLM's performance.\n","\n","<img src=\"images/RLHF.jpg\" width=\"600\">\n","\n","*Figure: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.* Source: [6].\n","\n","In summary, the RLHF approach creates a reward system that is augmented by human feedback and is used to teach LLMs which responses are more aligned with human preferences. Through these iterations, LLMs can be better aligned with our human values and can lead to higher-quality responses, as well as improved performance on specific tasks.\n","\n","Note also that there are several variants of the RLFH approach for finetuning LLMs. For example, LlaMA models employ two reward models: one based on the ranks of helpfulness of the responses, and another based on the ranks of safety of the responses. The final reward score is obtained as a combination of the helpfulness and safety scores.\n","\n","**Reinforcement Learning with Direct Policy Optimization (DPO)**\n","\n","RL with Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) is another approach for LLM alignment that has been popular recently, as it is simpler than RLHF with PPO. DPO uses a different optimization approach in comparison to RL with PPO, where DPO optimizes the LLM directly based on user preferences, without the need for training a separate Reward Model.

The matrices $W_A$ and $W_B$ are called low-rank adapters, since they have lower rank $r$ in comparison to the original weight matrix, i.e., they have fewer number of columns or rows, respectively. During training, gradients are backpropagated only through the matrices $W_A$ and $W_B$, while the pretrained weights $W$ remain frozen.\n","\n","For instance, if the full weight matrix $W$ is of size $100 \\times 100$, this is equal to $10,000$ elements (model weights). If we decompose the weight update matrix $\\nabla{W}$ by using rank $r=5$, the total number of elements of $W_A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{100 \\times 5}$ and $W_B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5 \\times 100}$ will be $500 + 500 =  1,000$. Hence, with LoRA the number of elements was reduced from $10,000$ to $1,000$.\n","\n","<img src=\"images/LoRA.png\" width=\"600\">\n","\n","*Figure: Regular finetuning versus LoRA finetuning .* Source: [7]."],"metadata":{"id":"XS2wNFlwlgD1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 21.3.3 Quantized LoRA (QLoRA) <a name='21.3.3-quantized-lora-(qlora)'></a>\n","\n","**Quantized LoRA (QLoRA)** is a modified version of LoRA that uses 4-bit quantized weights. *Quantization* reduces the precision for the values of the network weights. In TensorFlow and PyTorch, the network weights by default are stored with 32-bit floating-point precision. With quantization techniques, the network weights are stored with lower precision, such as 16-bit, 8-bit, or 4-bit precision.\n","\n","This approach introduces a new 4-bit quantization format called \"nf4\" (normalized float 4) where the range of values is normalized to the range [-1, 1] by dividing the values evenly into 16 bins (4-bit allows $2^4=16$ values). While 4-bit floating point precision (fp4) applies non-linear floating point representation of the original values and results in unequal spacing of the values, normalized float 4 precision (nf4) applies linear quantization of the original values into equally spaced bins and follows a normal distribution.\n","\n","QLoRA combines 4-bit quantization of the model weights in the pretrained model and LoRA that adds low-rank adaptor layers. The benefits of QLoRA with 4-bit quantization of the model weights include reduced size of the model and increased inference speed, while having a modest decrease in the overall model performance.\n","\n","For example, with QLoRA a 70B parameter model can be finetuned with 48 GB VRAM, in comparison to 780 GB VRAM required for finetuning all weights of the original model (using 32-bit floating-point precision). Similarly, QLoRA enables to train the smaller version of LlaMA 2 with 7B parameters on a T4 GPU (provided by Google Colab) that has 16 GB VRAM. In cases when only a single GPU is available, using quantization is necessary for finetuning LLMs."],"metadata":{"id":"SfoWFu-JjxUr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 21.4 Finetuning Example: Finetuning LlaMA-2 7B<a name='21.4-finetuning-example:-finetuning-llama-2-7b'></a>"],"metadata":{"id":"n8BHP3m4ntWm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","### Import Libraries\n","\n","We will begin by installing the required libraries and importing modules from these packages.

Here are some ways you could assess the performance of an LLM:\n","\n","1. Perplexity (or perplexing): Assess how well the generated samples resemble the training data or the expected output. Lower perplexity values indicate better coherence between the sample and input context. To measure perplexity for an LLM, calculate the average log probability of correctness across all generated examples in a batch. The lower this number is, the more likely the generator produces coherent outputs.\n","2. Language Modeling Quality Metrics: These include measures such as BLEU score, ROUGE F-score, METEOR score, etc., which evaluate the similarity between the generated texts and the original reference inputs. There are also more advanced evaluation methods that combine different scores from these categories, such as PERMA (a combination of perplexity and accuracy). Higher scores indicate greater linguistic competency demonstrated by your generative model. It’s essential to use appropriate pretrained language models while implementing these scoring systems to ensure reliable results relevant to natural language understanding tasks performed on specific datasets. For example, if developing a text generation system based solely off of general knowledge questions rather than factual answers requiring context-specific details within given topics – choose the appropriate topic-based metric instead! This will help ensure accurate evaluations tailored toward particular requirements without overestimating capabilities too far outside intended application areas; conversely risk underestimation due to overspecialization into irrelevant domains altogether leading towards poor overall performances during testing phases where real world test cases would expose such weak points quickly before implementation becomes commercially viable product(s) relying heavily upon them being functional beyond stated limits defined during initial setup processes involving careful feature engineering choices made during algorithm development stages prioritizing predictive accuracy against known truth targets found useful inside validated databases. Additionally there exist qualitative evaluations options available including manual inspection methods conducted by human experts who have access only limited information regarding content generation process used internally during LM development process - allowing deeper understanding insights into both strengths & limitations shared among peers sharing similar experiences helping refine models further increasing potential impact once\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Another prompt\n","prompt = \"Write a poem about Data Science.
