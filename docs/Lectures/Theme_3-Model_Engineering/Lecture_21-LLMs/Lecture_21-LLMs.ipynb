    "- *Statistical language models (1980s-2000s)*: developed to predict the probability of a word in a text sequence based on the preceding words. Examples of statistical language models include Bag-Of-Words models based on N-grams. These models were used in tasks like speech recognition and machine translation, but struggled with capturing long-range dependencies and context-related information in text.\n",
    "- *Neural network models (2000-2017)*: Fully-connected NNs and Recurrent NNs emerged as an alternative to statistical language models. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNN models were used for sequence-to-sequence tasks (such as  machine translation) and they formed the basis for several early LLMs. Similar to statistical language models, RNNs struggled with capturing context-related information. Other limitations of RNNs include the inability to parallelize the data processing, and the gradients can become unstable during training.\n",
    "- *Transformer network models (2017-present)*: Transformer networks introduced the self-attention mechanism as a replacement for the recurrent layers in RNNs. This architecture enabled the development of more powerful and efficient LLMs, laying the foundation for BERT, GPT, and modern LLMs."

    "\n",
    "The first step in creating LLMs is **pretraining** the model on massive amounts of text data. The datasets usually consist of a large collection of web pages or e-books comprising billions or trillions of tokens, and ranging from gigabytes to terabytes of text. During pretraining, the model learns the structure of the language, grammar rules, facts about the world, and reasoning rules. And, it also learns biases and harmful content present in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    " Pretraining is performed using unsupervised learning techniques. Two common approaches for pretraining LLMs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Causal Language Modeling**, also known as autoregressive language modeling, involves training the model to predict the next token in the text sequence given the previous tokens. This approach is more common with modern LLMs.\n",
    "- **Masked Language Modeling**, where a certain percentage of the input tokens are randomly masked, and the model is trained to predict the masked tokens based on the surrounding context. BERT and earlier LLMs were pretrained with masked language modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure depicts the pretraining phase with Causal Language Modeling, where the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence given the previous words.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Figure: Pretraining LLMs.* Source: [3].\n",

    "Pretraining allows to extract knowledge from very large unlabeled datasets in unsupervised learning manner, without the need for manual labeling. Or, to be more precise, the \"label\" in LLMs pretraining is the next word in the text, to which we already have access since it is part of the training text. Such pretraining approach is also called self-supervised training, since the model uses each next word in the text to self-supervise the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that pretraining LLMs from scratch is computationally expensive and time-consuming. As we stated before, the pretraining phase can cost millions of dollars (e.g., the estimated cost for training GPT-4 is $100 million). Also, pretraining LLMs requires access to large datasets and technical expertise with strong understanding of deep learning workflows, working with distributed software and hardware, and managing model training with thousands of GPUs simultaneously."

    "\n",
    "After the pretraining phase, the model is finetuned on a much smaller dataset, which is carefully generated with human supervision. This dataset consists of samples where AI trainers provide both queries (instructions) and model responses (outputs), as depicted in the following figure. That is, *instruction* is the input text given to the model, and *output* is the desired response by the model. The model takes the instruction text as input (e.g., \"Write a limerick about a pelican\") and uses next-token prediction to generate the output text (e.g., \"There once was a pelican so fine ...\").\n",

    "### 21.2.3 Alignment <a name='21.2.3-alignment'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "To further improve the performance and align the model responses with human preferences, LLMs are typically refined in one additional phase. This ensures that the responses generated by LLMs are aligned with human preferences, making the models more useful and safer for interaction with users. The alignment phase is essential for reducing harmful, biased, or otherwise undesirable outputs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Two main strategies for LLM alignment include Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Reinforcement Learning with Direct Policy Optimization (DPO).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM alignment with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) by employing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is depicted in the figure below and involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Collect human feedback*. For this step a new dataset is created by collecting sample prompts from a database or by creating a set of new prompts. For each prompt, multiple responses are generated by the supervised finetuned model. Next, AI trainers are asked to rank by quality all responses generated by the model for the same prompt, from best to worst. Such feedback is used to define the human preferences and expectations about the responses by the model. Although this ranking process is time-consuming, it is usually less labor-intensive than creating the dataset for supervised finetuning, since ranking the responses is faster than writing the responses.\n",
    "2. *Create a reward model*. The collected data with human feedback containing the prompts and the ranking scores of the different responses are used to train a Reward Model (denoted with RM in the figure). The task for the Reward Model is to predict the quality of the different responses to a given prompt and output a ranking score. The ranking scores provided by AI trainers are used to establish the ground-truth for training the Reward Model. Note that the Reward Model is a different model than the LLM that is being finetuned, and it only needs to rank the generated responses by the LLM.\n",
    "3. *Finetune the LLM with RL*. The LLM is finetuned using the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). For a new prompt, the original LLM generates a response, which the Reward Model evaluates and calculates a reward score $r_k$. Next, the PPO algorithm uses the reward score $r_k$ to finetune the LLM so that the total rewards for the generated responses by the LLM are maximized. I.e., the goal is to generate responses by the LLM that maximize the predicted reward scores, and by that, the responses become more aligned with human preferences and are more useful to human users.\n",
    "4. *Iterative improvement*. The RLHF process is performed iteratively, with multiple rounds of collecting additional feedback from human labelers, re-training the Reward Model, and applying Reinforcement Learning. This leads to continuous refinement and improvement of the LLM's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/RLHF.jpg\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*Figure: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.* Source: [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the RLHF approach creates a reward system that is augmented by human feedback and is used to teach LLMs which responses are more aligned with human preferences. Through these iterations, LLMs can be better aligned with our human values and can lead to higher-quality responses, as well as improved performance on specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that there are several variants of the RLFH approach for finetuning LLMs. For example, LlaMA models employ two reward models: one based on the ranks of helpfulness of the responses, and another based on the ranks of safety of the responses. The final reward score is obtained as a combination of the helpfulness and safety scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement Learning with Direct Policy Optimization (DPO)**\n",
    "\n",
    "RL with Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) is another approach for LLM alignment that has been popular recently, as it is simpler than RLHF with PPO. DPO uses a different optimization approach in comparison to RL with PPO, where DPO optimizes the LLM directly based on user preferences, without the need for training a separate Reward Model. I.e., DPO aims to directly maximize the reward function to produce model outputs that align with human preferences. Detailed explanation of RL with DPO is beyond the scope of this lecture.\n"

    "To adapt LLMs to a custom task, different finetuning techniques have been applied. *Full model finetuning* is a method that finetunes all the parameters of all the layers of a pretrained model.

    "This is depicted in the following figure, where regular finetuning is shown in the left figure, and it involves updating all weights $W$ in a pretrained model. As we know, the weight update matrix $\\nabla{W}$ is calculated based on the negative gradient of the loss function. Finetuning with LoRA is shown in the right figure, where the weight update matrix $\\nabla{W}$ is decomposed into two smaller matrices, $\\nabla{W}=W_A*W_B$, with size $W_A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{A \\times r}$ and $W_B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times B}$. The matrices $W_A$ and $W_B$ are called low-rank adapters, since they have lower rank $r$ in comparison to the original weight matrix, i.e., they have fewer number of columns or rows, respectively. During training, gradients are backpropagated only through the matrices $W_A$ and $W_B$, while the pretrained weights $W$ remain frozen.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the full weight matrix $W$ is of size $100 \\times 100$, this is equal to $10,000$ elements (model weights). If we decompose the weight update matrix $\\nabla{W}$ by using rank $r=5$, the total number of elements of $W_A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{100 \\times 5}$ and $W_B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5 \\times 100}$ will be $500 + 500 =  1,000$. Hence, with LoRA the number of elements was reduced from $10,000$ to $1,000$.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Quanitized LoRA (QLoRA)** is a modified version of LoRA that uses 4-bit quantized weights. *Quantization* reduces the precision for the values of the network weights. In TensorFlow and PyTorch, the network weights by default are stored with 32-bit floating-point precision. With quantization techniques, the network weights are stored with lower precision, such as 16-bit, 8-bit, or 4-bit precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach introduces a new 4-bit quantization format called \"nf4\" (normalized float 4) where the range of values is normalized to the range [-1, 1] by dividing the values evenly into 16 bins (4-bit allows $2^4=16$ values). While 4-bit floating point precision (fp4) applies non-linear floating point representation of the original values and results in unequal spacing of the values, normalized float 4 precision (nf4) applies linear quantization of the original values into equally spaced bins and follows a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "QLoRA combines 4-bit quantization of the model weights in the pretrained model and LoRA that adds low-rank adaptor layers. The benefits of QLoRA with 4-bit quantization of the model weights include reduced size of the model and increased inference speed, while having a modest decrease in the overall model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with QLoRA a 70B parameter model can be finetuned with 48 GB VRAM, in comparison to 780 GB VRAM required for finetuning all weights of the original model (using 32-bit floating-point precision). Similarly, QLoRA enables to train the smaller version of LlaMA 2 with 7B parameters on a T4 GPU (provided by Google Colab) that has 16 GB VRAM. In cases when only a single GPU is available, using quantization is necessary for finetuning LLMs."

Unterscheidung between realistic and non-realistic text generation, evaluating coherence and fluency, assessing accuracy in specific domains or tasks are some ways you could go about this evaluation process.\n",

      "2. BLEU score (B): Assess the similarity between the generated text and ground truth by comparing their n-gram frequency distributions. A higher BLEU score indicates more similarities between the two texts.\n",
      "3. ROC curve (R): Generate test data from a known dataset and train a classifier on it; then use that trained model to predict whether a given sample contains valid or invalid information. The area under the curve represents overall performance.\n",
      "4. F1-score (F1): Calculate the harmonic mean of precision and recall when judging the generations' ability to generate grammatically correct sentences. Higher scores demonstrate improved linguistic understanding and translation skills.\n",
      "5. Distinct Ratio (DR): Compare the number of unique words used in each sentence across both training and testing sets. A higher distinct ratio shows the generator produces more diverse outputs rather than repeating phrases too frequently.\n",
      "6. Frequency Weighted Likelihood (FWL) measures the likelihood of each word being correctly generated based on its frequency in the target distribution. This metric focuses on high-frequency words, as they contribute most significantly towards accurate text generation.\n",
      "7. Character Accuracy Rate (AC): Count instances where all characters within a given sequence match corresponding character positions in either training data or desired result. It provides an overview of the model's ability to produce accurate letter-level predictions.\n",
      "8. Fluency Score(FS): Assesses how natural and fluent the generated text appears. It does so by analyzing factors such as grammar usage consistency, sentence structure appropriateness according to the style provided during training or prompts provided after generation completion etcetera.

We can notice that LLaMA 2 uses special tokens for start-of-sequence `<s>` and end-of-seqence `</s>` to define the beginnings and ends of conversations. It uses the start-of-instruction tag `[INST]` and end-of-instruction tag `[/INST]` for single instruction-response pairs. I.e.,  everything inside `[INST]` and `[/INST]` is structured into system, user, and assistant roles. The system message is wrapped in `<<SYS>>` and `<</SYS>>` tags.

    "**Prompt engineering** is a technique for improving the performance of LLMs by providing detailed context and information about a specific task. It involves creating text prompts that provide additional information or guidance to the model, such as the topic of the generated response. With prompt engineering, the model can better understand the kind of expected output and produce more accurate and relevant results.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Use clear and concise prompts: The prompt should be easy to understand and provide enough information for the model to generate relevant output. Avoid using jargon or technical terms.\n",
    "- Use specific examples: Providing specific examples can help the model better understand the expected output. For example, if you want the model to generate a story about a particular topic, include a few sentences about the setting, characters, and plot.\n",
    "- Vary the prompts: Use prompts with different styles, tones, and formats to obtain more diverse outputs from the model.\n",
    "- Test and refine: Test the prompts on the model and refine them by adding more detail or adjusting the tone and style.\n",
    "- Use feedback: Use feedback from users or other sources to identify areas where the model needs more guidance and make adjustments accordingly.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "An example of a chain-of-thought prompt is as follows: \"You are a virtual tour guide from 1901. You have tourists visiting Eiffel Tower. Describe Eiffel Tower to your audience. Begin with (1) why it was built, (2) how long it took to build, (3) where were the materials sourced to build, (4) number of people it took to build it, and (5) number of people visiting the Eiffel tour annually in the 1900's, the amount of time it completes a full tour, and why so many people visit it each year.

    "\n",
    "**Foundation Models** are extremely large NN models trained on tremendous amounts of data with substantial computational resources, resulting in high capabilities for transfer learning to a wide range of downstream tasks. In other words, these models are scaled along each of the three factors: number of model parameters, size of the training dataset, and amount of computation. And, they are typically trained using self-supervised learning on unlabeled data. The scale of Foundation Models leads to new emergent capabilities, such as the ability to perform well on tasks that the models were not explicitly trained to do. This allows few-shot learning, which refers to finetuning Foundation Models to new downstream tasks by using only a few training data instances for the new task. Similarly, zero-shot learning extends this concept even further, and refers to a model's ability to generalize to new tasks for which the model hasn't seen any examples during the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs represent early examples of Foundation Models, because LLMs are trained at scale and can be adapted for various NLP tasks, even for tasks they were not trained to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term Foundation Models is more general than LLMs, and they generally refer to large models that are trained on multimodal data, where the inputs can include text, images, audio, video, and other data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of Foundation Models is in their potential to replace task-specific ML models that are specialized in solving one task (i.e., optimized to perform well on one dataset) with general models that have the capabilities to solve multiple tasks. I.e., these models can serve as a foundation that is adaptable to a broad range of applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Computational resources*: Training LLMs requires significant computational resources, making it difficult for researchers with limited access to GPUs or specialized hardware to develop and use these models.\n",
    "- *Data bias*: LLMs are trained on vast amounts of data from the internet, which often contain biases present in the data. As a result, the models may unintentionally learn and reproduce biases in their generated responses.\n",
    "- *Producing hallucinations*: LLMs can produce hallucinations, which are responses that are false, inaccurate, unexpected, or contextually inappropriate. One example of hallucination by ChatGPT is when asked to list academic papers by an author, and it provides papers that don't exist.\n",
    "- *Inability to explain*: LLMs are inherently black-box models, making it challenging to explain their reasoning or decision-making processes, which is essential in certain applications like healthcare, finance, and legal domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethical considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Privacy concerns*: LLMs memorize information from their training data, and can potentially reveal sensitive information or violate user privacy.\n",
    "- *Misinformation and manipulation*: Text generated by LLMs can be exploited to create disinformation, fake news, or deepfake content that manipulates public opinion and undermines trust.\n",
    "- *Accessibility and fairness*: The computational resources and expertise required to train LLMs may lead to an unequal distribution of benefits, where only a few organizations have the resources to develop and control these powerful models.\n",
    "- *Environmental impact*: The large-scale training of LLMs consumes a significant amount of energy contributing to carbon emissions, which raises concerns about the environmental sustainability of these models.\n",

As you will notice in the following code, the Unsloth tools use pre-built components from Hugging Face (such as `transformers`, `trl`) and adapt them to optimize various workflows for model training and inference.\n",

For this example, the training time was similar to training LlaMA 2 7B with the Hugging Face library above, as in both cases training for 1 epoch took about 15 minutes. On the other hand, while the largest batch size (in multiples of 2) with Hugging Face was 8 samples, Unsloth allowed to use a batch size of 16, meaning that Unsloth optimized the memory usage. Training LLMs with larger batch sizes is related to reduced training variance and more stable gradient updates, which typically result in improved performance. In addition, the inference with Unsloth was faster."

These models are designed to be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as language translation, text summarization, or chatbot responses.\n",
      "Lamini models are trained using a technique called masked language modeling, where a portion of the input text is randomly replaced with a [MASK] token. The model is then trained to predict the original text instead of the [MASK] token. This technique helps the model learn the context and relationships between words in a sentence.\n",
      "Lamini models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks by adding a task-specific layer on top of the pre-trained model. This layer is trained to perform the specific task, such as language translation or text classification.\n",
