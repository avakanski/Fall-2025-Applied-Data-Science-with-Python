For instance, in NLP, self-attention mechanism is used to identify words in sentences that have significance for a given query word in the sentence. That is, the model should pay more attention to some words in sentences, and less attention to other words in sentences that are less relevant for a given task.  \n","\n","In the following two sentences, in the left subfigure the word \"it\" refers to \"street\", while in the right subfigure the word \"it\" refers to \"animal\". Understanding the relationships between the words in such sentences has been challenging with traditional NLP approaches. Transformers use the self-attention mechanism to model the relationships between all words in a sentence, and assign weights to other words in sentences based on their importance. In the left subfigure, the mechanism estimated that the **query word** \"it\" is most related to the word \"street\", but the word \"it\" is also somewhat related to the words \"The\" and \"animal. These words are referred to as **key words** for the query word \"it\".The intensity of the lines connecting the words, as well as the intensity of the blue color, signifies the attention scores (i.e., weights). The wider and bluer the lines, the higher the attention scores between two words are.\n","\n","<img src=\"images/attn_1.png\" width=\"700\">\n","\n","*Figure: Attention to words in sentences.*"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Specifically, Transformer Network compares each word to every other word in the sentence, and calculates attention scores. This is shown in the next figure, where for example, the word \"caves\" has the highest **attention scores** for the words \"glacier\" and \"formed\". The attention scores are calculated as the dot (i.e., inner) product of the input representations of two words. That is, for each Query word $Q$ and Key word $K$, the attention score is $Q\\cdot K$.\n","\n","\n","<img src=\"images/attn_2.png\" width=\"300\">\n","\n","*Figure: Attention scores.*"],"metadata":{"id":"pR2M0cOujAnl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Transformers employ word embeddings for representing the individual words in text sequences (where each text sequence can have one or several sentences). Recall from the previous lectures that **word embeddings** are vector representations of words, such that the vectors of words that have similar semantic meaning have close spatial positions in the embeddings space. Therefore, the attention scores are dot products of the embedding vectors for each pair of words in sentences.\n","\n","The obtained attention scores for each word are then first scaled (by dividing the values by $\\sqrt d$) and afterward are normalized to be in the [0,1] range (by applying a softmax function). That is, the attention scores are calculated as $a_{ij}=softmax(\\frac{Q_i\\cdot K_j}{\\sqrt d})$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the embedding vectors. As we stated in previous lectures, the dimensionality of embedding vectors in modern Large Language Models typically ranges from 768 to 4,096 dimensions. Scaling the values by $\\sqrt d$ is helpful for improving the flow of the gradients during training.\n","\n","The resulting scaled and normalized attention scores are then multiplied with the initial representation of the words, which in the self-attention module is referred to as **value** or $V$. This is shown in the next figure. The left subfigure shows the attention scores calculated as product of the input representations of the words $Q$ and $K$, which are afterwards multiplied with the input representation $V$ to obtain the output of the self-attention module. Note that for text classification, all three terms Query, Key, and Value are the same input representation of the words in sentences. However, the original Transformer was developed for machine translation, where the words in the target language are queries, and the words in the source language are pairs of keys and values. This terminology is also related to search engines, which compare queries to keys, and return values (e.g., the user submits a query, the search engine identifies key words within the query to search for, and it returns the results of the search as values). Self-attention works in a similar way, where each query word is matched to other key words, and a weighted value is returned.\n","\n","The right subfigure below shows how self-attention is implemented in Transformer Networks. Namely, `Matmul` stands for a matrix multiplication layer which calculates the dot product $Q\\cdot K$, which is afterwards scaled by $\\sqrt d$, then there is an optional masking layer , and afterward the final attention scores are obtained by passing it through a `Softmax` layer to obtain $softmax(\\frac{Q_i\\cdot K_j}{\\sqrt d})$. Finally, the attention scores are multiplied with $V$ via another matrix multiplication layer `Matmul` to calculate the output of the self-attention module. The optional masking layer can be used for two purposes: (a) to ensure that attention scores are not calculated for the padding tokens in padded sequences (e.g., 0 is often used as the padding token), but instead are calculated only for the positions in input sequences that have actual words in padded sequences; or (b) to set the attention scores for future tokens to zero, so that the model can only attend to previous tokens, as explained in the section below on decoder sub-networks).\n","\n","<img src=\"images/attn_3.png\" width=\"400\">\n","\n","*Figure: Self-attention in Transformer Networks*"],"metadata":{"id":"UiIXXTnSwvXs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In conclusion, self-attention is applied to capture the meaning of the words in a sentence based on its surrounding context.

Each self-attention module is called **attention head**, and the aggregation of the outputs of multiple attention heads is called **multi-head attention**. For instance, the original Transformer model had 8 attention heads, while LLamA 3 language model has 32 attention heads.\n","\n","The multi-head attention module is shown in the next figure, where the inputs are first passed through a linear layer (i.e., fully-connected dense layer), next they are fed to the multiple attention heads, and the outputs of all attention heads are concatenated, and passed through one more linear layer.\n","\n","A logical question one may ask is why are multiple attention heads needed? The reason is that multiple attention modules can learn different relationships between the words in sentences. Each module can extract context independently from the other modules, which allows to capture less obvious context and enhances the learning capabilities of the model. For example, one head may capture relationship between the nouns and numerical values in sentences, another head may focus on the relationship between the adjectives in sentences, and another head may focus on rhyming words, etc. And, if one head becomes too specialized in capturing one type of patterns, the other heads can compensate for it and provide redundancy that can improve the overall performance of the model.\n","\n","Also, the computations of each attention head can be performed in parallel on different workers, which allows for accelerating the training and scaling up the models.\n","\n","<img src=\"images/multihead_1.png\" width=\"600\">\n","\n","*Figure: Multi-head attention*"],"metadata":{"id":"-jIbvAu3qj02"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 19.4 Encoder Block <a name='19.4-encoder-block'></a>"],"metadata":{"id":"cQJzrp1Kqk1O"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The **Encoder Block** in Transformer Networks is shown in the next figure.

Differently from the text classification task where for an input text sentence the model predicts a class label, in machine translation for an input text sentence in a source language the model predicts the corresponding text sentence in a target language. Therefore, both the input and output of the model are text sequences. These type of models are called **sequence-to-sequence models**, or oftentimes this term is abbreviated to **seq2seq models**. Beside machine translation, other NLP tasks that employ seq2seq models include question answering, text summarization, dialog generation, and others.\n","\n","The architecture of Transformer Networks designed to handle seq2seq tasks consists of encoder and decoder sub-networks.\n","\n","- **Encoder sub-network** takes a source text sequence as an input, and extracts a useful representation of the text data.\n","- **Decoder sub-network** takes a target text sequence as an input, as well as it receives the intermediate representation from the encoder sub-network.

This approach allows the model to produce coherent and relevant responses by chatbots.\n","\n","An example of autoregressive text generation is shown in the next figure. For instance, the first generated word by the model is *Binge*, and given this word, the model assigns probabilities to all possible next words. The considered words shown in the top line in the figure include *on*, *and*, *of*, *is*, etc. The generated word is *drinking*. Next, the model considers the words *Binge drinking* and generates the next word. This process is repeated for the entire output text, where the model takes as input all previously generated words, and generates the next word in the sequence. Note that this process is computationally expensive, since the model needs to repeatedly evaluate all previous words to generate every new word; as a result, inference with autoregressive models requires significant resources and time.   \n","\n","<img src=\"images/next-word-prediction.png\" width=\"600\">\n","\n","*Figure: Autoregressive text generation.

The main difference from the encoder is the *masked multi-head attention* module in the lower part of the decoder. This module is inserted before the multi-head attention module in the decoder. Masked multi-head attention module applies masking to the next words in the target sequence, so that the network does not have access to those words. That is, during training, if the model needs to predict the 4th word in a sentence, masks will be applied to all words after the 3rd word, so that the model has access only to the words 1, 2, and 3, in order to predict the 4th word.\n","\n","<img src=\"images/transformer.png\" width=\"700\">\n","\n","*Figure: Transformer Network*"],"metadata":{"id":"zDTIt98p6Pzm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["For example, in the next figure, for predicting the word *with* the model has access to the attention coefficients only for the words *Your*, *journey*, and *starts*, whereas the attention coefficients for the words *with*, *one*, and *step* are masked and the model does not have access to those values.

However, Transformer Networks were designed for working with sequential data, while images are spatial data types. To consider each pixel in an image as a sequential token would be impractical and too time-consuming. Therefore, ViT splits images into a set of smaller image patches (16x16 pixels), and it uses the sequence of image patches as inputs to the model (i.e., each image patch is considered a token). Each image patch is first flattened to one-dimensional vector, and those vectors are afterward passed through a dense layer to learn lower-dimensional embeddings for each patch. Positional embeddings and class embeddings are added, and the sequences are fed to a standard transformer encoder. Class embeddings are vectors that correspond to different classes in the dataset.
