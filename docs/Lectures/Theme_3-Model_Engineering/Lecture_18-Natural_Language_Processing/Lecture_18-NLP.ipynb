One disadvantage of this type of tokenization is that antigrams (words with same letters in different order, such as *silent* and *listen*) can have the same numerical encoding, which can affect the performance of ML models. As well as, character-level tokenization does not capture semantic meaning of words as effectively as word-level tokens. Consequently, it is not widely used in practice.\n","- *Word-level tokenization* - each word in the text is a token. This type of tokenization provides a natural representation of input text with the words as building blocks of language, and it is commonly used.\n","- *Subword-level tokenization* - the words are divided into smaller units (e.g., tokenizing the word \"unhappiness\" into two tokens \"un\" + \"happiness\"). This type of tokenization is very common in recent Large Language Models. Also, in some languages with complex word structures, subword-level tokenization is the most suitable.\n","- *N-gram tokenization* - N consecutive words represent a token. For instance, N-grams consisting of two adjacent words are called bigrams, or three words constitute a trigram, etc. N-gram tokens preserve the words order and can potentially capture more information in the text. For instance, for spam filtering using  bigram tokens such as *mailing list* or *bank account* may provide more helpful information than using word-level tokens.\n","\n","For some NLP tasks, tokenization can also be performed at other levels of text.

Conversely, in RNNs, there is a feedback loop at each time step, which creates the *recurrence*. This is shown in the next figure, where at each time step of the RNN model, an input (e.g., word) is processed, then in the next step the succeeding word is processed based on the information from the previous word, etc. This way, the network can learn dependencies between words that are not adjacent.\n","\n","<img src=\"images/rnn.png\" width=\"600\">\n","\n","*Figure: Recurrent Neural Network.*\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2xBfAgEAzEm2"},"source":["There are three major types of RNN layers: conventional (a.k.a. basic, simple, vanilla) RNN, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and GRU (Gated Recurrent Units).

In Keras, the conventional (basic) RNN is called SimpleRNN, and LSTM and GRU are called as they are written.\n","\n","While SimpleRNN has difficulty in handling long sequences, LSTM and GRU have the ability to store and preserve long-term dependencies over many time steps.
