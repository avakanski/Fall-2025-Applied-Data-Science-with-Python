In 1803, the city's only water source was the Hudson River. By 1857 the city was experiencing flooding as a result of the Great War. A new, privately owned water station opened in 1908, which was built on the site of the once-rich river, the Hudson. In the early 1900s, the city's water supply declined due to the Hudson's rising water table and the loss of steam engines. In the early 1930s, the city began planning a new major river service on the Hudson, which was the first to utilize steam power.\n","\n","The Hudson River has been the subject of numerous historical and scientific research.
